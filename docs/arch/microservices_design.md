# **BeaverOS: Microservices Architecture Design**

---

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1. Purpose of the Document**
This document outlines the architectural design principles, core components, and strategic considerations for the microservices architecture of the BeaverOS platform. It serves as a foundational guide for developers and architects, ensuring consistency, scalability, and maintainability across all services.

### **1.2. What are Microservices?**
Microservices are an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service typically focuses on a single business capability, communicates via lightweight mechanisms (like APIs), and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### **1.3. Why Microservices for BeaverOS?**
BeaverOS leverages a microservices architecture for several compelling reasons:

* **Scalability:** Individual services can be scaled horizontally based on demand, optimizing resource utilization.
* **Resilience:** Failure in one service is less likely to bring down the entire system, thanks to isolated deployments and fault tolerance mechanisms.
* **Independent Deployment:** Teams can develop and deploy services autonomously, enabling faster release cycles and continuous delivery.
* **Technology Diversity:** Different services can use the most appropriate technology stack (language, database) for their specific needs, avoiding technology lock-in.
* **Team Autonomy:** Smaller, focused teams can own and manage specific services, improving agility and accountability.
* **Modularity:** Enables easier understanding, maintenance, and replacement of individual components.

### **1.4. Scope**
This document covers the high-level design of the microservices ecosystem for BeaverOS, including inter-service communication, data management strategies, deployment considerations, and architectural best practices. Detailed API specifications for each service are found in their respective `openapi.yml` files.

## **2. Architectural Principles**

The BeaverOS microservices architecture adheres to the following core principles:

* **Loose Coupling:** Services are designed to be as independent as possible, minimizing direct dependencies and allowing changes to one service without impacting others.
* **High Cohesion:** Each service encapsulates a single, well-defined business capability. It "does one thing and does it well."
* **Bounded Contexts:** Each service defines its own explicit boundaries and domain model, ensuring clear responsibilities and preventing an "anemic domain model."
* **Independent Deployment:** Services are built and packaged to be deployable in isolation without requiring redeployment of other services.
* **Decentralized Data Management:** Each microservice owns its data store, encapsulating its data model and logic. Direct database access between services is forbidden.
* **Resilience & Fault Tolerance:** Services are designed to handle failures gracefully (e.g., via retries, circuit breakers, fallbacks) to prevent cascading failures.
* **Observability:** The architecture prioritizes centralized logging, monitoring (metrics), and distributed tracing to provide deep insights into system behavior and performance.
* **Automation:** Extensive use of CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment of services.
* **API-First Design:** Services expose well-documented and versioned APIs (REST/HTTP) as their primary means of communication.

## **3. Core Components of the Architecture**

### **3.1. Individual Microservices**
Each service represents a distinct business capability. In the initial MVP, key services include:

* **`auth-user-service`**: Manages user authentication, authorization (JWT-based), and user profiles.
* **`service-entity-service`**: Handles the creation and management of business entities (tenants), stores, and ensures multi-tenant data isolation.
* **`product-catalog-service`**: Manages products, categories, pricing, inventory levels, and product variations.
* **`order-service`**: Responsible for creating, processing, and managing sales orders, including returns and refunds.
* **`payment-service`**: Integrates with external payment gateways and manages payment transactions.
* **`report-service`**: Generates various business reports based on data from other services.
* **`workflow-service`**: Manages and executes automated business workflows (e.g., low stock alerts, email notifications).

### **3.2. API Gateway**
(Future consideration for complex deployments)
A centralized API Gateway would serve as the single entry point for all client requests. Its responsibilities would include:
* **Request Routing:** Directing requests to the appropriate microservice.
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Pre-processing requests for security before forwarding to services.
* **Rate Limiting:** Protecting services from excessive traffic.
* **Load Balancing:** Distributing requests across multiple instances of a service.
* **SSL Termination:** Handling encrypted connections.

For the MVP, clients will directly call specific service endpoints.

### **3.3. Inter-service Communication**
* **Synchronous:** Primarily **RESTful APIs over HTTP/S** for request-response interactions between services. Each service exposes its public API through `openapi.yml`.
* **Asynchronous (Future/Advanced):** For loosely coupled communication and event-driven patterns, a **message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)** may be introduced to enable services to publish events and subscribe to events from other services. This is especially useful for eventual consistency and background processing.

### **3.4. Databases**
* **Database per Service:** Each microservice operates with its own dedicated PostgreSQL database instance (or a separate schema within a shared database if resource constraints are tight, but logical separation is paramount). This enforces data encapsulation and independent evolution.
* **ORM:** Services utilize Object-Relational Mappers (e.g., SQLAlchemy for Python) for database interactions.

### **3.5. Service Discovery**
* **Client-Side Discovery:** For development and simple deployments (Docker Compose), services rely on known network names (e.g., Docker service names).
* **Platform-Provided Discovery:** In production environments (e.g., Kubernetes), DNS-based service discovery is utilized, where services register themselves and can be found by their logical names.

### **3.6. Logging & Monitoring**
* **Centralized Logging:** All services send their logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, or Grafana Loki).
* **Metrics Collection:** Services expose metrics (e.g., via Prometheus exporters) that are collected by a central monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus).
* **Distributed Tracing (Future):** Tools like Jaeger or OpenTelemetry will be implemented to trace requests across multiple services for easier debugging and performance analysis.

### **3.7. Containerization & Orchestration**
* **Containerization:** All microservices are packaged as **Docker images**, ensuring consistent execution environments across development, testing, and production.
* **Orchestration:**
    * **Development/Local Testing:** **Docker Compose** is used to orchestrate local development environments.
    * **Production Deployment:** **Kubernetes** is the target orchestration platform for production, providing robust features for deployment, scaling, healing, and management of containerized applications.

## **4. Data Management Strategy**

### **4.1. Database per Service**
Each service has its own dedicated database. This is a critical pattern for microservices, preventing tight coupling at the data layer and allowing independent schema evolution.

### **4.2. Eventual Consistency**
For business transactions that span multiple services (distributed transactions), the **Saga pattern** or **eventual consistency** will be applied. This means that data across services might not be immediately consistent but will eventually synchronize through asynchronous event propagation.

### **4.3. Data Migration**
Each service manages its own database migrations, typically through version-controlled migration scripts (e.g., Alembic for Python).

---

## **5. Deployment Model**

* **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines will be implemented for each microservice, ensuring that code changes are automatically tested, built, and deployed to staging/production environments.
* **Immutable Infrastructure:** Deployments will follow an immutable infrastructure pattern, where new versions of services are deployed by replacing existing instances rather than updating them in place.

---

## **6. Security Considerations**

* **API Security:** All external and inter-service API calls are secured using HTTPS/TLS. API keys, JWTs, and OAuth2 will be used for authentication and authorization.
* **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data at rest (database) and in transit will be encrypted.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Services and users are granted only the minimum necessary permissions.
* **Secrets Management:** Environment variables, API keys, and sensitive configuration will be managed securely (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, Vault).

## **7. Challenges and Mitigation**

Implementing a microservices architecture introduces specific complexities. Our mitigation strategies include:

* **Complexity:**
    * **Mitigation:** Focus on well-defined service boundaries, robust documentation (`openapi.yml`, `README.md`), and clear communication between teams.
* **Distributed Data Management:**
    * **Mitigation:** Embrace the "database per service" pattern and plan for eventual consistency with clear event-driven mechanisms.
* **Testing:**
    * **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and contract tests for each service. Utilize end-to-end tests for critical user journeys.
* **Debugging:**
    * **Mitigation:** Implement distributed tracing and centralized logging from the outset.
* **Operational Overhead:**
    * **Mitigation:** Heavily automate deployments and infrastructure management using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
