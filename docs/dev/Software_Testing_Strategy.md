# **BeaverOS: Software Testing Strategy**

---

## **1. Introduction**

This document defines the comprehensive software testing strategy for **BeaverOS**, the open-source commerce platform. Its purpose is to ensure the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements, guaranteeing its reliability, security, performance, and usability within a microservices and multi-tenant environment. The strategy prioritizes automation, early defect detection, and continuous quality verification throughout the development lifecycle.

---

## **2. Testing Principles**

Our testing strategy is built upon the following fundamental principles:

* **"Shift-Left" Testing:** Integrate testing as early as possible in the development cycle to detect and fix defects efficiently.
* **Automation First:** Prioritize test automation at all levels for efficiency, repeatability, and consistency. Manual testing is reserved for exploratory testing and final validation.
* **Risk-Based Approach:** Prioritize testing in high-risk areas (e.g., critical business logic, multi-tenant security, performance under load).
* **Mandatory Multi-Tenant Testing:** All relevant tests must explicitly validate correct functionality and, **CRITICALLY**, data isolation between different tenants/businesses.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Aim for adequate test coverage at both code and feature levels, tailored to the criticality of each component.
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD)/Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Encourage TDD practices for microservices and BDD for complex functionalities where applicable.

## **3. Testing Levels**

The following testing levels will be applied to the BeaverOS microservices architecture:

### **3.1. Unit Tests**
* **Objective:** Verify the internal logic and correct functioning of individual code units (functions, methods, classes) within each microservice.
* **Who:** Developers (as part of their development cycle).
* **When:** Continuously, upon writing or modifying code. Automatically executed on every commit.
* **Coverage:** High code coverage for critical components.
* **Platform Focus:** Ensure that the data models and logic of each unit consider the `tenant_id` and its generality.

### **3.2. Component/Service Tests (Internal Microservice Integration)**
* **Objective:** Verify the correct functioning of a complete microservice, including its internal interactions (e.g., with its database) and its API surface.
* **Who:** Developers / QA.
* **When:** After unit tests and before integration with other services. Automatically executed on every microservice build.
* **Platform Focus:** Validate that APIs expose information generically and that `tenant_id` storage works correctly within the service.

### **3.3. Integration Tests (Between Microservices)**
* **Objective:** Verify the correct communication and interaction between multiple microservices.
* **Who:** QA / Developers.
* **When:** After individual microservices are stable. Automatically executed in integration environments.
* **Platform Focus:**
    * Validate complex business flows involving multiple services (e.g., create order -> add items -> process payment -> update KDS status).
    * **CRITICAL:** Ensure `tenant_id` propagates correctly through inter-service calls and that data remains isolated.

### **3.4. System Tests (End-to-End)**
* **Objective:** Validate the complete user flow through the entire system, from the desktop client application's user interface to the backend, databases, and back.
* **Who:** QA.
* **When:** After all microservices have been integrated and deployed in a complete test environment.
* **Platform Focus:**
    * Simulate a complete "business" use from start to finish.
    * Perform tests with **multiple concurrent "businesses" (tenants)** to verify isolation and cross-functional behavior where applicable (e.g., `auth-user-service` managing multiple tenants).

### **3.5. User Acceptance Tests (UAT)**
* **Objective:** Validate that the system meets business expectations and requirements from the end-user's perspective.
* **Who:** Pilot users / Stakeholders.
* **When:** Before the MVP release to production.
* **Platform Focus:** Ensure that basic customization and the generalized user experience are intuitive for the business type.

## **4. Specific Test Types**

In addition to the testing levels, the following types of tests will be conducted:

### **4.1. Functional Testing**
* **Detail:** Verify that every functional requirement specified in the SRS is correctly met. Includes positive, negative, and edge-case testing.
* **Platform Focus:** Validation of item management flexibility, generic order flow, and multi-tenant user/role management.

### **4.2. Performance and Load Testing**
* **Detail:** Evaluate the system's capacity to handle an increasing number of users, transactions, and, fundamentally, **multiple concurrent tenants**. Includes stress and scalability tests.
* **Platform Focus:**
    * Simulate workloads of multiple businesses operating simultaneously.
    * Measure latency of critical transactions under load.
    * Identify bottlenecks in microservices and the database with a growing number of tenants and data.

### **4.3. Security Testing**
* **Detail:** Identify vulnerabilities and ensure data protection. Includes authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, and secure configuration testing.
* **Platform Focus:**
    * **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation:** This is the most critical security test. Ensure that one `Tenant` cannot access or modify another `Tenant`'s data under any circumstances.
    * Injection tests (SQL, XSS, etc.).
    * Session and token management (JWT).
    * Vulnerability analysis (using automated tools).

### **4.4. Usability Testing (UI/UX)**
* **Detail:** Evaluate the ease of use, efficiency, and user satisfaction with the BeaverOS interface.
* **Platform Focus:** Ensure that the modular and customizable design remains intuitive and consistent, even with different configurations for various business types.

### **4.5. Compatibility Testing**
* **Detail:** Verify that the system functions correctly in different hardware environments (receipt printers) and operating systems (Linux).
* **Platform Focus:** Confirm the portability of Docker containers across various server configurations.

### **4.6. Resilience and Recovery Testing**
* **Detail:** Verify how the system behaves in the face of component failures (e.g., a microservice crashes, database disconnects) and its ability to recover.
* **Platform Focus:** Ensure that a microservice failure does not bring down the entire platform, and that data is correctly recovered after a restart.

## **5. Test Environments**

* **Local Development Environment:** Each developer will run relevant microservices locally with Docker Compose.
* **Continuous Integration (CI) Environment:** An automated environment where every `push` or `merge request` triggers unit and integration test execution.
* **Staging/System Test Environment:** An environment that replicates the production environment as closely as possible, including all databases and microservices. System, performance, and security tests will be executed here. Docker Compose will be used for its initial orchestration.

---

## **6. Tools and Automation Strategy**

* **Unit/Component Tests:** `pytest` for Python (FastAPI), testing frameworks for C++.
* **Integration/API Tests:** `pytest` with `httpx` (for API calls), `Postman` or `Insomnia` for manual tests and automated collections.
* **System Tests (End-to-End UI):** UI automation frameworks (e.g., `Playwright`, `QtTest` for C++/Qt UI).
* **Load/Performance Tests:** `Locust`, `JMeter`.
* **Security Analysis:** SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools in CI/CD, vulnerability scanners for Docker images.
* **CI/CD:** GitLab CI/CD (or GitHub Actions) to automate test execution at each pipeline stage.

---

## **7. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Developers:** Responsible for writing unit and integration tests for their own code and resolving defects.
* **QA Engineer(s) (Future):** Responsible for designing test plans, writing and executing integration, system, performance, and security tests, and managing defects.
* **Lead Developer/Project Lead:** Responsible for the overall testing strategy and ensuring product quality.
* **Pilot Users:** Responsible for User Acceptance Tests (UAT) and providing feedback.

## **8. Test Metrics and Reporting**

* **Code Coverage:** % of code covered by unit tests.
* **Defect Rate:** Number of defects found per test phase/level.
* **Defect Severity:** Classification of defects (critical, major, minor, cosmetic).
* **Automated Test Execution Time:** To ensure CI/CD efficiency.
* **% of Test Cases Executed/Passed:** For each test level.
* **Performance and Security Reports:** Summary of critical findings.
