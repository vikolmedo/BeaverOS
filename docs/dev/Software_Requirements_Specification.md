The BeaverOS platform shall provide the following high-level capabilities in its initial MVP phase:
* **User & Authentication Management:** Secure user registration, login, session management, and role-based access control.
* **Multi-Tenant Management:** Creation, configuration, and isolation of multiple business entities (tenants) or locations.
* **Business Entity & Store Management:** Define and manage physical or logical business entities, stores, and their associated data.
* **Product & Inventory Management:** Create, update, and manage products/services, stock levels, categories, pricing, and variations.
* **Order & Transaction Management:** Process sales transactions, handle returns, manage order lifecycle, and track payment status.
* **Customer Management:** Maintain customer profiles, purchase history, and basic CRM data.
* **Payment Processing:** Integrate with external payment gateways to handle various payment methods.
* **Reporting:** Generate essential business reports (e.g., sales summaries, inventory reports).
* **Workflow Automation:** Enable configurable workflows for common business processes (e.g., low stock alerts).

### **2.3. User Characteristics**
BeaverOS caters to a diverse set of users:
* **System Administrators:** Responsible for initial setup, system configuration, multi-tenant management, and overall platform maintenance. (Technical proficiency: High)
* **Store Managers/Owners:** Manage product catalog, inventory, staff, run reports, and oversee daily operations for a specific tenant. (Technical proficiency: Medium)

* **Developers/Contributors:** Build new features, fix bugs, create integrations, and extend the platform. (Technical proficiency: High)
* **Business Stakeholders:** Need access to high-level reports and analytics, understand strategic direction. (Technical proficiency: Low)

### **2.4. General Constraints**
* **Open Source:** Must adhere to GNU GPL v3.0 license.
* **Microservices Architecture:** All new features and services must align with the established microservices pattern.
* **Technology Stack:** Primary backend services in Python (FastAPI/SQLAlchemy), Desktop client in C++ (Qt), Admin Web Panel in JavaScript (React/Next.js). Databases are PostgreSQL.
* **Scalability:** Must be capable of scaling horizontally to accommodate increasing user load and data volume.
* **Data Sovereignty:** Architecture must enable businesses to self-host and control their data.
* **Localization:** System must support multi-language and multi-currency capabilities for future global expansion.

### **2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies**
* A stable internet connection is available for cloud deployments and external API integrations.
* Users have basic computer literacy to operate the client applications.
* Third-party services (e.g., payment gateways) will provide stable APIs and documentation.
* The project will have a growing and engaged open-source community for sustainability.
