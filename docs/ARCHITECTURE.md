# BeaverOS Architecture - Microservices

BeaverOS is designed as a modular microservices-based system to enable scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. Below is an initial proposal for the key microservices and their responsibilities.

## Core Services

* **User Service:**
    * **Responsibility:** Management of user profiles, roles, permissions, and authentication credentials (integration with Firebase Auth for identity).
    * **Potential Technologies:** Node.js/Python, MongoDB/PostgreSQL, Firebase Auth.

* **Product & Inventory Service:**
    * **Responsibility:** Management of products (creation, update, deletion), inventory tracking (stock levels, locations), and supplier relationships.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Node.js/Python, Firestore/MongoDB, Redis (for inventory cache).

* **POS Service (Point of Sale):**
    * **Responsibility:** Handling sales transactions (order creation, simulated payment processing, discount application), shopping cart management.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Node.js/Python, Kafka (for sales events), Stripe/PayPal (payment integration).

* **Order Management Service:**
    * **Responsibility:** Order processing (from creation to fulfillment), order status tracking, transaction history.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Java/Kotlin, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ (for order queues).

* **Reporting & Analytics Service:**
    * **Responsibility:** Aggregation and processing of sales and inventory data to generate reports and dashboards, trend analysis.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Python (Pandas/NumPy), Apache Spark, Data Warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery), Power BI/Tableau (visualization).

* **Supplier & Purchasing Service:**
    * **Responsibility:** Management of supplier information, purchase orders, goods receipt.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Node.js/Python, PostgreSQL.

* **Core API Gateway:**
    * **Responsibility:** Single entry point for all frontend requests, routing to appropriate microservices, initial authentication and authorization.
    * **Potential Technologies:** Nginx/Kong, Express.js.

## Key Considerations

* **Inter-Service Communication:** RESTful APIs, gRPC, Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) with message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ).
* **Databases:** Each service should have its own database (Database per Service pattern).
* **Deployment:** Containers (Docker), Orchestration (Kubernetes), Serverless (Cloud Functions, Lambda).
* **Monitoring & Observability:** Prometheus/Grafana, ELK Stack.
