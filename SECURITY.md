## **3. Our Vulnerability Response Process**

Once we receive a vulnerability report, our security team will follow these steps:

1.  **Acknowledgement (24-48 hours):** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 to 48 business hours.
2.  **Investigation and Triage:** We will investigate the vulnerability to understand its nature and impact. This includes attempting to reproduce it.
3.  **Communication:** We will keep you informed about the progress of our investigation and the status of the vulnerability.
4.  **Remediation:** We will develop a patch or solution for the vulnerability. The complexity of the solution will determine the time needed.
5.  **Disclosure:** Once a solution has been implemented and an update released, we will coordinate with you for the public disclosure of the vulnerability, if desired. Generally, we aim for responsible disclosure after users have time to update.
6.  **Acknowledgements:** We will recognize your contribution to BeaverOS security in our [Acknowledgements/Contributors](CONTRIBUTING.md or a dedicated file) file or release notes, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## **4. Scope and Exclusions**

This security policy covers the source code and applications directly developed and maintained by the BeaverOS project.

Currently, we do not operate a bug bounty program. However, we greatly value your time and effort, and we will ensure your contribution is publicly recognized if you wish.

## **5. Guidelines for Security Testing**

* **Do not access or modify existing user data.** If you need data for testing, use your own local development instance.
* **Avoid denial-of-service (DoS) or brute-force attacks** that could affect the availability of our services or infrastructure.
* **Limit your testing to the latest available version** of BeaverOS.
