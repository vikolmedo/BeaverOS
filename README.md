## **üöÄ Why BeaverOS?**

In a world dominated by e-commerce giants, many businesses face challenges such as:

- **High Costs:** Proprietary software with expensive licenses and recurring fees.
- **Lack of Control:** Dependence on third parties for data and functionality management.
- **Low Flexibility:** "All-in-one" solutions that don't adapt to the specific needs of each business.
- **Information Silos:** Difficulty integrating different management systems.

**BeaverOS** addresses these issues by offering:

- **Free and Open Source (GPLv3):** Reduces your operating costs and gives you the freedom to modify and adapt the software to your needs.
- **Extreme Modularity:** Built with microservices, it allows you to activate only the functionalities you need and scale each component independently.
- **NATIVE Multi-Tenant:** Ideal for companies with multiple branches, franchises, or even service providers managing different clients with complete data isolation.
- **Full Data Control:** As an _on-premise_ or self-hosted solution, your data is yours. Always!
- **Active Community:** Benefit from the support of a global community of developers and users.

    - **Enable Firebase Authentication:** Go to `Build > Authentication > Sign-in method` and enable `Email/Password`.
    - **Configure Firestore Database:** Go to `Build > Firestore Database` and ensure it's set up with security rules that allow authenticated users to read and write to their private collection (`/artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/products`).
    - **Get your Firebase configuration:** In your Firebase project, go to `Project settings` (the gear icon) > `Your apps` > `Web app` (if you don't have one yet, create a web app). Copy the configuration details (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, appId, measurementId).
    - **Create an environment variables file:** In the root of your web project (`web/`), create a file named `.env.local` and paste your Firebase configuration as follows:
      ```
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_apiKey_here
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_authDomain_here
