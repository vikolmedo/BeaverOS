## **üöÄ Why BeaverOS?**

In a world dominated by e-commerce giants, many businesses face challenges such as:

* **High Costs:** Proprietary software with expensive licenses and recurring fees.
* **Lack of Control:** Dependence on third parties for data and functionality management.
* **Low Flexibility:** "All-in-one" solutions that don't adapt to the specific needs of each business.
* **Information Silos:** Difficulty integrating different management systems.

**BeaverOS** addresses these issues by offering:

* **Free and Open Source (GPLv3):** Reduces your operating costs and gives you the freedom to modify and adapt the software to your needs.
* **Extreme Modularity:** Built with microservices, it allows you to activate only the functionalities you need and scale each component independently.
* **NATIVE Multi-Tenant:** Ideal for companies with multiple branches, franchises, or even service providers managing different clients with complete data isolation.
* **Full Data Control:** As an *on-premise* or self-hosted solution, your data is yours. Always!
* **Active Community:** Benefit from the support of a global community of developers and users.
