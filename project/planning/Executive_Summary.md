## **2. Problem Statement**

The modern commerce landscape presents significant challenges for businesses, particularly Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and growing enterprises:

* **High Costs & Vendor Lock-in:** Proprietary POS and e-commerce solutions demand significant upfront and recurring licensing fees, often tying businesses to specific vendors.
* **Lack of Control & Data Silos:** Businesses often lack full control over their own data, residing in third-party clouds, and struggle with integrating disparate systems.
* **Limited Flexibility & Customization:** "One-size-fits-all" solutions rarely meet unique business needs, making customization expensive or impossible.
* **Scalability Barriers:** Legacy systems or expensive proprietary solutions can hinder growth when businesses need to expand, add locations, or integrate new sales channels.

## **3. Solution: BeaverOS**

BeaverOS directly addresses these problems through its core design principles:

* **Open Source (GPLv3):** Eliminates licensing costs, provides full transparency, and fosters community-driven innovation.
* **Microservices Architecture:** Ensures extreme modularity, allowing businesses to use only what they need and scale individual components independently.
* **Native Multi-Tenant Support:** Designed from the ground up to support multiple distinct businesses, branches, or tenants within a single deployment, with strong data isolation.
* **Self-Hostable:** Gives businesses complete control over their infrastructure and, crucially, their data.
* **Universal POS Focus (MVP):** Starts with a robust and adaptable POS system that serves as the foundation for broader commerce capabilities.
